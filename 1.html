In Hebrew, there are five letters that have different forms when they appear at the end of a word. These final forms are called “sofit” (סופית). Here they are:
<ul>
<li>ך (kaf sofit): This is the final form of the letter “kaf.”</li>
<li>ם (mem sofit): This is the final form of the letter “mem.”</li>
<li>ן (nun sofit): This is the final form of the letter “nun.”</li>
<li>ף (pe sofit): This is the final form of the letter “pe.”</li>
<li>ץ (tsadi sofit): This is the final form of the letter “tsadi.”</li>
</ul>
These letters are written differently when they appear at the end of a word, but their pronunciation remains the same. Interesting, isn’t it?
